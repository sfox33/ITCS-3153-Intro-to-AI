Homework 2
Pacman Search Algorithms

No particular issues with submitting.  Design decisions for A* were based off of my information
from ITCS 2215.  Design decisions for the CornersProblem was based on the already existing
search problems.  The food Heuristic was mostly based off of trial and error.  My initial idea
did not work as well as I had hoped, so several heuristics were tried in order to see how
well they would work.  My current one worked the best out of all of them by the utograder's
standards. It should be noted that the code for BFS was updated to work with the current problems.

And so it is clearly stated, I do NOT want homework 1 to be regraded for 50% credit.
