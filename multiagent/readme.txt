Pacman MiniMax and Expectimax Algorithms

No particular problems with submissions.  A lot of the design choices were based off of trial and error.  While it all makes sense looking back,
I had a lot of trouble figuring out the best way to express the algorithms in Python.  A lot of tricks (such as the fact that infinity can be expressed
in Python) were found by accident throughout the design process, and were implemented halfway through.  I am still not entirely sure that I have the
most efficient methods, but everything seems to be working as I believe it is supposed to.
